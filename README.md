Follow the instructions below to replicate findings from Garg, K., Kello, C. T., & Smaldino, P. E. (2022). Individual exploration and selective social learning: balancing explorationâ€“exploitation trade-offs in collective foraging. Journal of the Royal Society Interface, 19(189), 20210915. 

    The main code for ABM is in _main_module.ipynb_

    Some data files for each parameter combination are in the folder 'data'. The code to replicate the figures in the main text is in the Jupyter Notebook called 'analysis'. The notebook reads in files from 'data'. 


    To visualize the model and generate output files:

    1. Access Binder link by clicking on the badge--> [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ketikagarg/collective_foraging/HEAD)
    2. Wait for Binder to build the repository. It will automatically launch JupyterLab. 
    3. Click on 'Help' and select 'Launch Classic Notebook'. A new page will take you to a list of files.
    4. **Open _'Visualize.ipynb'_ and run it.**
