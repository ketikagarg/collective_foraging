The main code for ABM is in _main_module.ipynb_

Some data files for each parameter combination are in the folder 'data'. The code to replicate the figures in the main text is in the Jupyter Notebook called 'analysis'. The notebook reads in files from 'data'.

2. Wait for Binder to build the repository. It will automatically launch JupyterLab. 
3. Click on 'Help' and select 'Launch Classic Notebook'. A new page will take you to a list of files.
